Title:
Migration of MERIT to Next.js - POC

Description:
Conduct a proof of concept (POC) for migrating our legacy React application to Next.js. This POC will assess technical feasibility, performance improvements, and integration with current functionalities. The goal is to ensure that the transition to Next.js offers significant benefits and can be accomplished without major issues and most important we are
able to deploy this along with our current application so we can do a transition in phases.

Acceptance Criteria:

	1.	Performance:
	•	Evaluate and document the performance improvements of the application.
	•	Compare load times and server-side optimization between legacy React and Next.js.
	2.	Functionality:
	•	Ensure all migrated functionalities work correctly in Next.js.
	•	Conduct unit and integration tests to validate behavior.
	3.	Documentation (optional):
	•	Document the migration process, including challenges encountered and solutions.
	•	Provide a guide for future steps in the full migration.
	4.	Deployment:
	•	Deploy the migrated application to a staging environment.
	•	Ensure the application can be accessed and tested by business.
	5.	POC Presentation:
	•	Prepare a demonstration of the migrated application.
	•	Gather feedback from the technical team and stakeholders.
